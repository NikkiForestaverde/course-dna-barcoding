00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.480
hello my name is tim hirsch i'm deputy director&nbsp;
at gbiff the global biodiversity information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.960
facility i'm going to take a few minutes to give&nbsp;
you a basic introduction to gbiff who we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.680
what we do and why we do it hopefully it will give&nbsp;
a bit of context to the rest of this training and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.040
motivate you to use the skills you'll be acquiring&nbsp;
in this course to support gbiff's mission

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.160
so what is gbif well we're an intergovernmental&nbsp;
network and research infrastructure with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.480
overall purpose of providing anyone anywhere with&nbsp;
free and open access to data about all types of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.440
life on earth gbif was established in 2001 and&nbsp;
it's a voluntary collaboration among governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.720
and international organizations the gbif&nbsp;
participants working through a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.600
memorandum of understanding or mou this mou sets&nbsp;
out the basic principles of sharing data for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.240
common good and the way gbif should be governed&nbsp;
and funded under the mou each gbif participant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.720
agrees to set up a node to coordinate data sharing&nbsp;
and use among stakeholders in the country or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.280
organization a secretariat based in copenhagen&nbsp;
denmark manages the technical infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.960
and supports the collaborations that keep&nbsp;
gbif going and growing as a global community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.680
as you'll see from the gbiff.org homepage on the&nbsp;
right this community is now managing very large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.240
volumes of data shared from hundreds of publishing&nbsp;
institutions around the world and used in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.920
growing body of research to support understanding&nbsp;
and decisions relating to biodiversity

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.280
one way to look at gbiff is as a window&nbsp;
on the huge amount of evidence accumulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.440
over centuries about where species have lived&nbsp;
and when they lived there the evidence takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.000
many different forms and often starts out&nbsp;
scattered isolated and inaccessible here are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.480
some examples and you can follow this if you look&nbsp;
at the semicircle on the left starting at the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.120
and working anti-clockwise specimens literally&nbsp;
billions of them collected from around the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.360
along with the labels that describe them contain&nbsp;
vital evidence which may be literally locked away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.360
in the drawers of natural history collections&nbsp;
observations from surveys and monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.760
programs as well as the increasing activities&nbsp;
of citizen scientists are recorded and stored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.120
in varying formats literature about the natural&nbsp;
world both historic and current often contains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.520
detailed information on species occurrences but&nbsp;
it's embedded and effectively hidden in the text&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.400
it needs liberating automated wildlife records&nbsp;
such as through satellite tracking camera traps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.440
or acoustic monitoring add yet more to this&nbsp;
wealth of evidence and finally large volumes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.120
data derived from dna sequencing of samples from&nbsp;
the environment so called edna provide evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.400
of previously hidden biodiversity the key to&nbsp;
discovering and applying all of this evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.720
is the use of common standards a common language&nbsp;
if you like that organizes all the essential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.040
facts according to an agreed vocabulary even if&nbsp;
they started out in a mess of different formats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.960
that's one of the things you'll be&nbsp;
learning much more about in this course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.280
once organized using agreed standards data sets&nbsp;
can be shared or published through gbiff and using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.120
the technical infrastructure of the network easily&nbsp;
discovered by users through filtered searches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.320
plotted on maps and used in models always&nbsp;
with clear links back to the original evidence

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.520
so we've brought all of this data together but&nbsp;
for what purpose through tracking the citations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.680
of gbif in research and its onward relevance to&nbsp;
policy and decisions we can build up a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.920
how all of those involved in sharing standardized&nbsp;
data from the volunteer wildlife observer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.000
researchers and museum curators are contributing&nbsp;
to the knowledge that supports better decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.120
for our planet and for our societies here are just&nbsp;
some examples data shared through gbif supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.760
conservation by helping to identify&nbsp;
the most important sites for protected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.920
areas by underpinning assessment of species&nbsp;
extinction risk through the red listing process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.320
and by tracking the actual and predicted spread&nbsp;
of invasive alien species data shared through gmif&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.960
supports food security by mapping the distribution&nbsp;
of the wild relatives of the most important food&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.720
crops and therefore the location of the genetic&nbsp;
resources that need to be conserved for future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.840
plant breeding and by providing information on&nbsp;
both marine and freshwater fish species along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.800
other wild species important for nutrition data&nbsp;
shared through gbiff supports action on climate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.440
change through helping to model how species ranges&nbsp;
will change under different climate scenarios&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.920
informing strategies to adapt to climate change&nbsp;
and assessing the impacts of measures to mitigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.720
climate change for example increased production&nbsp;
of biofuels and hydropower and finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.040
data shared through gbif supports human health&nbsp;
by tracking the distribution of species that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.080
act as vectors hosts and reservoirs of human&nbsp;
diseases by helping to map medicinal plant species&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.640
and by assessing risks posed by significant&nbsp;
public health hazards such as snake bite

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.000
gpiff provides technical solutions but it is above&nbsp;
all a global community its people collaborating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.600
to develop skills and good practices in the&nbsp;
management sharing and use of biodiversity data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.320
this biodiversity informatics community&nbsp;
of practice has over the years generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.160
a variety of tools and guidance materials which&nbsp;
are all freely available through the gbif network&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.640
increasingly in multiple languages at the heart of&nbsp;
this collaboration is training through the use of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.640
curricular and e-learning like the course you're&nbsp;
following now another key feature is the use of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.200
our growing pool of volunteer mentors experienced&nbsp;
gbif practitioners who help new colleagues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.240
get started with advice and technical guidance&nbsp;
today's trainees soon become tomorrow's mentors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.880
and so the community of practice grows g this&nbsp;
network of nodes helps develop these skills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.680
both within a country's institutions and&nbsp;
through collaboration at regional and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.160
global levels through a range of programs&nbsp;
and partnerships gbif brings funding into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.000
projects that enhance biodiversity informatics&nbsp;
capacity among countries and institutions

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.920
so welcome to the gbif community and good luck if&nbsp;
you have questions on this presentation please use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.720
the forum provided in the e-learning platform this&nbsp;
video is part of a series of presentations used in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.080
the gbif biodiversity data mobilization course&nbsp;
the curriculum for this course was originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.840
developed as part of the biodiversity information&nbsp;
for development program the bid program funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:54.800
by the european union this presentation&nbsp;
was created and narrated by me tim hirsch
