=== Exercise tips

==== Validation checks

*Technical errors*
Relatively simple, often able to be automated, *checks against the integrity of the data*. 
These may indicate incorrect exports, data mapping, field slippage (e.g. moving 1 column to the right) or data missing at the source.

* *Completeness*: 
Whether all the data and metadata is available â€“ are all fields present, are all fields filled out?
* *Bounds*: 
For example, are days given in the range 1-31 (depending on month)
* *Data type*: 
For example, does the Date field contain a date or a number?
* *Data format*: 
For example, are Dates provided as 01/01/2010 or 01/Jan/10?

*Consistency errors*

Application of real-world rules to the data.
These may indicate incorrect data entry from older records, transcription errors or post processing.
Some are complex to implement and *require reference data sets to check against*. 
E.g. a list of known collectors and collecting habits. 
These rules can be gathered from data users and analysts.

* *Taxonomic*: 
For example, if identified to species level, have a binomial scientific name and entries in genus and species fields been provided?
* *Currency*: 
Are dates of collection, identification, update and digitization consistent?
* *Outliers*: 
Detect outliers, but remember that not all outliers are necessarily errors. 
For example, compare against a known species range, or known environmental range (but remember that outliers may be misidentifications, rather than incorrect coordinates).
* *Geographic*: 
Are the coordinates within the identified locality or region? 
For example, are there any terrestrial occurrences in the sea or marine occurrences on land?
* *Collecting patterns*: 
Does the occurrence detail match the known collecting patterns of the organization or collector?
Do any records appear to have been created after a collector has died (could this possibly be a different collector with a similar name)?
For example, are any mammal records attributed to a bird watching group?
* *Accuracy and precision*: 
For example, are any georeferenced records indicating very high precision or accuracy from a pre-GPS (or pre-accurate GPS) collecting period?
* *Collecting methods*: 
Different survey methods (e.g. transects and area surveys) have particular characteristics. 
Are the records consistent with the method provided?
