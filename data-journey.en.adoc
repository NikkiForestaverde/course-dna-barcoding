== Data journey - bumblebee pollinators

[NOTE.objectives]
This data journey is a series of practical exercises focusing on bumblebee pollinators. 
Using GBIF and BOLD, you will learn: I. how to find and use already available biodiversity data in connexion with your research questions; II. How to efficiently capture and clean this data – i.e. put them in a standard format that is directly relevant and exploitable for you; III. How to generate and publish new data according to a international standards.

[NOTE.activity]
This data journey is comprised of nine steps. 
Each step (or set of steps), correlate to the different modules of the course. 
After a series of theoretical lectures, you will return to the Data Journey to complete the practical exercises. 
The practical exercises follow a path: I. the study system; II. questions and hypotheses; III. availability of data; IV. capture and cleaning of data; and V. generate and publish data.

==== Bumblebee pollinators

. What do we know about bumblebees in the Caucasus region?
.. How many species? Where are they distributed?
.. What are their preferred plant resources?
. Identify simple and clear research question
.. What resources and type of data you will need?
.. How much of this data already exists?

==== Caucasus ecoregion

image::img/web/DJC/DJC-3.png[align=center,width=640,height=360]

* One of the most species-rich regions in the world
* High endemism rates
* Accelerate biodiversity discovery
** Systematics
** DNA barcoding
** Biological metadata
* Some biodiversity data is already available
* Identify relevant datasets
* Mobilize them for addressing scientific & conservation issues
* Identify data gaps for future research

==== Public biodiversity databases

You may find the data in the ecoregion is not publicly available in all the databases so you will need to reflect on your strategy.
