The programme uses a combination of lectures, tutorials, and hands-on exercises.  You will learn to handle biodiversity data including DNA barcoding.  You will gain practical experience in using open and digitally documented biodiversity data through GBIF and BOLD to answer biodiversity research questions.  You will understand and practice capturing observation, collection, and genetic data from analogue and digital sources.  Finally, this course provides basic skills in data publishing through GBIF and BOLD."
